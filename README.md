IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1. The project consists of three main HTML pages: index.html (Google Search), image.html (Google Image Search), and advanced.html (Google Advanced Search).
2. CSS is used to style the pages to closely resemble Google's own search pages.
3. JavaScript handles the search queries and redirects users to the appropriate Google search results pages.
